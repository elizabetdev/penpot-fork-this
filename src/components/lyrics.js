      <p>
        Are you devs ready?
        <br />
        I’m a designer who codes!
        <br />
        Yeah! Let’s go!
        <br />
        I’ve been designing with Penpot <br />
        Open Source, connecting every dot
        <br />
        Server-side rendering Next <br />
        You can call me Explorer, Edge
        <br />
        No more lifecycles, React <br />
        You can call me lightweight, Preact
        <br />
        I’m way too complicated, Typescript
        <br />
        But I’m still in this class, type this
        <br />
        Learning from mistakes Microsoft
        <br />
        More than a million skills, Lara croft
        <br />
        Trying to not look back, Angular
        <br />
        I don’t have an expression, Regular <br />
        Animating SVGs, Original <br />
        Let me kill it one time, terminal
        <br />
        Watch me giving a talk, Netflix <br />
        I’m gonna keep it short, es6
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m coding like a criminal <br />
        Designing like a miracle <br />
        They say I’m Invisible
        <br />
        Fork this, I’m original
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, open source queen
        <br />
        Old school girl, coding with VIM
        <br />
        Git hub stars, git hub queen
        <br />
        Push it, Pull it, merging the thing
        <br />
        I’m an old school girl, hi5
        <br />
        Sonic and Tails, Megadrive
        <br />
        Coding and rhymes, Spotify
        <br />
        You devs can’t see me, wi-fi
        <br />
        No competition, goodbye
        <br />
        No one can reach me, all right
        <br />
        Another level, that’s right
        <br />
        Call me Eleven, Sci-fi
        <br />
      </p>
    </div>
